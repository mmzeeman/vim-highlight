# Highlight Color Scheme

A light color scheme which uses background highlighting,
like one would do with a real highlighter. The scheme does
a minimal amount of highlighting.

## Motivation

Most color themes highlight everything. By highlighting your
code this way the code ends up looking like paint splatter
art. By reducing the amount of colors used to more easier to
recognize separate elements in your code.

The theme uses background colors to highlight elements. Color
themes usually uses forground colors. When you like to use light
backgrounds, this means you have to use dark colors, which often
look less attractive. Hence I decided to highlight like one would
do with a real world highlighter.

The colors chosen are inspired by the colors used for notes in
the excellent free form mindmap tool
[Scapple](https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scapple/overview).
